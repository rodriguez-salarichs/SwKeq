# SwKeq
SwKeq calculates the equilibrium constant and the degree of polymerization of a protein using the concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient to 20oC in water (Sw20) and considering an isodesmic process

please type: SwKeq.x models So Mw file.txt

File format: Concentration(uM) vs. Sw20

Mw: It is the molecular weight (kDa)

models: In this option will choose the Hydrodinamic model for protein polymers
         
     if type 1 the hydrodinamic model will be N^2/3
     if type 2 the hydrodinamic model will be linear (spheres)
     if type 3 the hydrodinamic model will be linear (21 beads)
     if type 4 the hydrodinamic model will be Helical (spheres)
     if type 5 the hydrodinamic model will be Helical (21 beads)
     if type 6 the hydrodinamic model will be Helical (42 beads)
